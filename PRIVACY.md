This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data when you use the Contract Engine: Oil & Gas Edition web application (the “App”) and when you purchase access via Gumroad.

By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.

1. What this Product Is

Contract Engine: Oil & Gas Edition (“Contract Engine”, the “Service” or the “App”) is a web-based software tool for Landmen, legal consultants, Contracts & Procurement professionals, and other energy industry users.

The App uses Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to analyze Oil & Gas agreements (for example, leases, drilling contracts, and Master Service Agreements) and provide risk assessments, vendor intelligence, and negotiation insights.

Access to the App is unlocked via a license key that you purchase on Gumroad.

This Privacy Policy covers the data processed when:

You use the App at our hosted URL (e.g. Render / Streamlit)

We verify your license key against Gumroad

Your payment experience is governed by Gumroad’s Privacy Policy, not this document.

2. Data We Handle

We intentionally minimise the personal and contract data we process. We categorise the data as follows:

2.1 Uploaded contracts (Zero-Retention)

When you upload a document (PDF/DOCX/TXT), it is processed in memory to extract text and identify clauses.

We enforce a Zero-Retention Policy for contract content:

We do not save, store, or archive your contracts in any database, file system, or long-term storage controlled by us.

Once the analysis has been generated and returned to your browser, the contract text is discarded from the processing environment.

Because of this design, we do not maintain a historical archive of your contracts or the AI outputs.

2.2 License keys and purchase metadata

License Key: We process the license key you enter in the App to verify that you have a valid license associated with a Gumroad purchase.

Purchase Metadata: We can see certain purchase information inside Gumroad, such as:

Your email address

Product purchased

Purchase date and status

License key issued

We do not receive or store your credit card details, bank details, or PayPal credentials. Payments are processed entirely by Gumroad.

2.3 Vendor / counterparty names

If the AI identifies a counterparty or vendor name within a contract, the name of that company may be sent to a search provider (e.g. Google Search API) to check for:

Sanctions lists

Bankruptcy and financial distress

Adverse media (fraud, corruption, significant litigation, etc.)

We do not send full contracts or personal employee data to search engines.

2.4 Technical and usage data

When you access the App, our infrastructure may automatically log:

IP address

Browser type and version

Approximate location inferred from IP (city / region level)

Date and time of access

Error codes and performance metrics (e.g. failed API calls)

This is standard technical logging used to maintain and secure the Service.

3. When Data Leaves the App (Third-Party Processors)

To provide the Service, we rely on carefully selected third-party providers who process certain data on our behalf. They act as data processors under our instructions, or as independent controllers where specified.

3.1 OpenAI (AI provider)

Data sent: The text extracted from your uploaded contract, plus any prompts required for analysis.

Purpose: To perform risk analysis, red-flag detection, summarization, vendor intelligence, and negotiation coaching.

Privacy: We use OpenAI’s API in a configuration where submitted data is not used to train OpenAI’s public models. Processing is subject to OpenAI’s enterprise security and data protection commitments.

3.2 Gumroad (payments and licensing)

Data sent: Product identifiers and your license key (and, where needed, email address) for validation.

Purpose: To confirm that you have an active, paid license for Contract Engine and to manage billing, refunds, and receipts.

Controller role: Gumroad acts as an independent data controller for your payment and account data. Their privacy policy governs that processing.

3.3 Search provider (e.g. Google Search API)

Data sent: Company / vendor names extracted from your contract.

Purpose: To query public sources for information about sanctions, bankruptcy, or adverse media.

Note: We do not send full contract text to the Search API.

3.4 Hosting & infrastructure (Render, cloud providers)

Data processed: Encrypted traffic, temporary contract text in memory, logs, and telemetry required to operate the App.

Purpose: To host the App, route traffic, monitor performance, and maintain security.

We may change or add processors in the future, but will always maintain substantially similar safeguards.

4. How We Use Your Data

We use the data described above for the following purposes:

Delivering the Service

Generating risk matrices, executive summaries, negotiation guidance, and other outputs requested by you.

Verifying access

Checking your license key with Gumroad to ensure only eligible users can access the Service.

Maintaining reliability and security

Monitoring system health, error rates, and abuse patterns

Preventing fraudulent or unauthorised use of license keys

Compliance and record-keeping

Retaining purchase records inside Gumroad for tax, accounting, and legal audit purposes.

We do not use your contract content for marketing, behavioural profiling, or resale. We do not train our own models on your contracts.

5. Legal Bases (EU / UK Data Protection Law)

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or UK GDPR applies, we process personal data on the following legal bases:

Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)

To provide the App and its core features, including contract analysis, risk reporting, and licensing.

Without this processing, we cannot deliver the Service you purchased.

Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)

To prevent fraud and misuse of license keys

To secure our infrastructure and ensure service reliability

To analyse aggregated technical metrics to improve the App
We balance these interests against your rights and expectations and apply strict data minimisation.

Legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)

To retain transaction records required by tax and accounting law.

6. Data Retention

We apply different retention periods depending on the data type:

Contract data

Zero Retention. Uploaded contract content is processed in memory and discarded once the analysis is delivered to your browser. We do not store the contracts or outputs in a database under our control.

License validation logs

We may temporarily log that a specific license key was used from a given IP address at a given time, primarily for anti-fraud and technical debugging.

These logs are kept only as long as reasonably required for security and troubleshooting.

Purchase records (via Gumroad)

Retained by Gumroad in accordance with their own policies and with applicable tax and accounting laws.

Technical logs

Retained for a limited period (for example 30–180 days) to monitor performance and security, then deleted or anonymised.

7. Security Measures

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data, including:

Encryption in transit: All traffic between your browser and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS).

Ephemeral processing environments: Our cloud provider (e.g. Render) uses ephemeral instances that are regularly reset, reducing the risk of long-term data retention in memory.

No contract file database: We do not maintain a database of user-uploaded contracts or attachments.

Access controls: Access to Gumroad and infrastructure dashboards is restricted to authorised personnel and protected with strong authentication.

While no system can be guaranteed 100% secure, we strive to maintain a level of security appropriate to the risk.

8. Your Choices and Rights
8.1 Data minimisation choices

You may choose to redact highly sensitive data (names, coordinates, internal codes) from your contracts before uploading them. The analysis may be less precise, but this reduces exposure.

8.2 Rights under data protection laws

Where applicable (e.g. EU/UK residents), you have rights under the GDPR, including:

Right of access – to know whether we process your personal data and to receive a copy.

Right to rectification – to correct inaccurate personal data.

Right to erasure – to request deletion of personal data where we have no legal basis to keep it.

Right to restriction – to ask us to restrict processing in certain circumstances.

Right to object – to object to processing based on legitimate interests.

Right to data portability – to receive certain data in a structured, machine-readable format.

Because we do not store your contracts, we generally cannot retrieve or delete contract content after the analysis is complete — it has already been discarded from our systems.

For purchase data, license details, and email preferences, many controls are available directly inside Gumroad.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at md@jiculimited.com
. We may need to verify your identity before responding.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you believe your rights have been violated.

9. International Data Transfers

Our infrastructure and third-party providers (including OpenAI, Render, and Gumroad) may process data in the United States or other countries outside your home jurisdiction.

Where required by law, we rely on:

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or equivalent safeguards; and

Contractual commitments from our providers regarding security and confidentiality.

By using the Service, you understand that your data may be processed in these locations under the safeguards described in this Policy.

10. Children’s Privacy

The Service is not intended for children and is designed for professional and business users, typically over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

If you believe we have inadvertently collected data about a child, please email md@jiculimited.com
 and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:

Changes in our Service

Changes in our third-party providers

Updates to legal or regulatory requirements

When we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate, provide additional notice (for example, via the App or Gumroad product page).

Your continued use of the Service after any change constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
